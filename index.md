# Academic bullying

Over the past two years (2018-2020) a conversation about
[academic bullying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workplace_bullying_in_academia#cite_note-6)
has developed rapidly in academic science. Some activists claim that such
bullying is widespread in the scientific community and under-studied. Behaviors
fitting at least one definition of bullying have occurred before in the BISB
program, so BISB students would do well to pay attention to these developments.

The recently-launched [Academic Parity Movement](https://paritymovement.org) "is addressing academic
bullying, harassment, and discrimination at its root to ensure all bright minds
can excel and progress." They are conducting a [survey](https://wakeforest.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0uZSsSRmzJDVnb7)
to collect much-needed data about the problem.

Few formal studies of academic bullying have been carried out in the scientific
community. Here are a selection of news and opinion articles:
